/**
 * Return value from [Card.status] (`SCardStatus`).
 *
 * The status [Boolean]s ([unknown], [absent], [present], [swallowed], [powered], [negotiable] and
 * [specific]) have platform-specific differences:
 *
 * * On `pcsclite` (Linux and macOS), these are a bitmask.
 * * On Windows, only **one** of these will be true, as it represents the lifecycle of the card.
 *
 * For example, when a card is connected and the protocol has been negotiated:
 *
 * * `pcsclite` would have [present], [powered] and [specific] == `true`
 * * Windows would have [specific] == `true`, but [present] and [powered] == `false`
 *
 * See [pcsclite's API differences](https://pcsclite.apdu.fr/api/group__API.html#differences) for
 * more details.
